      HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on
      the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and final[3] major HTML version that
      is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current
      specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by
      the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a
      consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and
      Microsoft).

      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML
      or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a
      cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
      JavaScript.[2]

      JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming
      language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,
      alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the
      client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party
      libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
      execute the code on users' devices. JavaScript is a high-level, often
      just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
      standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
      and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven,
      functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
      programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular
      expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model
      (DOM).
